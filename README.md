Potential Improvements:
Error Handling:

While errors are caught in most routes, itâ€™s important to provide more specific error messages in the responses, especially for different types of errors (e.g., database connection issues, file upload issues). Custom error handling middleware might help centralize error management.
Validation and Sanitization:

It would be beneficial to add request validation (e.g., using express-validator or joi) for incoming requests, especially for user registration, login, and post creation. This helps ensure that all required fields are provided and have the correct formats.
Sanitize user input to avoid potential security vulnerabilities like NoSQL injection.
Scalability Considerations:

As your app grows, consider indexing commonly queried fields in MongoDB (e.g., email, nickname, postId) to improve query performance.
For file uploads, consider implementing storage solutions like Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage for scalability, instead of saving files locally.
Session Management with JWT:

You're using both JWT and session-based authentication in parallel. You might want to choose one strategy for consistency. Generally, JWT is better suited for stateless authentication, whereas sessions are useful for stateful, server-side tracking of user sessions.
If you stick with JWT, you could eliminate the session management and rely purely on token validation.
Security Enhancements:

Make sure your JWT secret (jwtSecret) is stored securely (e.g., in environment variables or a secrets manager).
Implement HTTPS (via express-sslify or a reverse proxy like Nginx) for secure communication.
File Upload Size Limits:

It might be a good idea to enforce limits on the file sizes and types being uploaded to avoid performance and security issues.
Code Modularity:

As the project grows, consider separating out different parts of the application into modular files (e.g., authRoutes.js, postRoutes.js, userRoutes.js) to keep the code clean and maintainable.
Optimizing Database Queries:

Some database queries (like the ones for posts and comments) can be optimized to reduce the number of operations. For instance, when populating comments in a post, try to limit the fields returned from the User model to reduce unnecessary data.
